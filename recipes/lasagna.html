        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My whole family loves this beefy lasagna flavored with taco seasoning. Even my picky five-year-old will eat it. Serve with shredded lettuce, fresh sliced tomatoes, olives and sour cream.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes with juice</li>
            <li>10 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1 cup prepared salsa</li>
            <li>Â½ cup shredded Colby cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef, and stir in the taco seasoning and tomatoes. Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with half the tortillas. Spoon the beef mixture into the dish, then top with the remaining tortillas. Spread salsa over the tortillas and sprinkle with the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
