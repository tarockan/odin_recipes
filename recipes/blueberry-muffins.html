        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 pint fresh blueberries - rinsed, drained and patted dry</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Position rack in the middle of oven. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray the top of a muffin pan with non-stick coating, and line with paper liners.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter, 1 1/4 cups sugar and salt until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Mix together 1 3/4 cup of the flour and baking powder. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated. Crush 1/4 of the blueberries, and stir into the batter. Mix the rest of the whole blueberries with the remaining 1/4 cup of the flour, and fold into the batter. Scoop into muffin cups. Sprinkle tops lightly with sugar.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until golden brown, and tops spring back when lightly tapped.</li>
        </ol>
